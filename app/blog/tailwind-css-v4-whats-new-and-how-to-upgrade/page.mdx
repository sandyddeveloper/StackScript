# üöÄ Tailwind CSS v4: What's New and How to Upgrade

##  Introduction
Tailwind CSS v4 is here, bringing a host of new features, improved performance, and breaking changes. Whether you're starting fresh or upgrading an existing project, this guide will help you understand what's new and how to transition smoothly.

## üÜï What's New in Tailwind CSS v4?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Boost with Rust-based Engine
Tailwind CSS v4 introduces a **Rust-based compiler**, replacing the previous JavaScript-based system. This change results in **faster build times** and improved performance.

```bash
# Upgrade Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Simplified Configuration
The default `tailwind.config.js` is now more concise, thanks to automatic class detection and improved handling of utility layers.

**Before (Tailwind v3):**
```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

**After (Tailwind v4):**
```js
export default {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"]
};
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Improved Dark Mode
Tailwind v4 introduces **`dark:media` mode**, which uses system preferences for a seamless dark mode experience.

```html
<div class="dark:bg-gray-900 dark:text-white p-4">
  This is in dark mode!
</div>
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ New Utility Classes
- **Grid Auto Layout:** `grid-auto-rows`, `grid-auto-cols`
- **New Text Utilities:** `text-balance`, `text-pretty`
- **CSS Variable Support:** Native support for `var(--custom-color)`

```html
<p class="text-pretty text-lg">This text is beautifully spaced.</p>
```

## üîÑ How to Upgrade from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4

### Step 1: Update Tailwind CSS
Run the following command to install the latest version:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest
```

### Step 2: Check for Deprecated Features
Tailwind v4 removes some legacy classes and configurations. Check your project for:
- Deprecated dark mode configurations
- Unused plugins or custom variants

### Step 3: Migrate Configuration
If you are using CommonJS, switch to ESM for the configuration file:
```bash
mv tailwind.config.js tailwind.config.mjs
```

Modify the file:
```js
export default {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"]
};
```

### Step 4: Test and Optimize
Run your project and test for any missing styles or errors:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Conclusion
Tailwind CSS v4 is a game-changer for modern frontend development, offering **faster builds, cleaner configurations, and new utilities**. Upgrading is straightforward, and the improvements make it worth the effort.
