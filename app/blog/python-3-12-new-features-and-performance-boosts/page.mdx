## üöÄ Python 3.12: New Features and Performance Boosts

Python 3.12 brings **major improvements** in terms of **performance**, **syntax enhancements**, and **security**. Let's explore what's new in this release!

---

## üî• Performance Improvements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Faster CPython Execution
Python 3.12 includes enhancements that improve the speed of CPython by optimizing **internals, bytecode execution, and memory usage**.

> Benchmarks suggest a **5-10% speed improvement** in real-world applications compared to Python 3.11.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Frame Stack Handling
A major refactor of frame objects has **reduced memory overhead** and improved **function call performance**.

```python
import dis

def sample_function():
    return sum([i for i in range(10)])

print(dis.dis(sample_function))  # Improved bytecode execution
```

## üéØ New Features in Python 3.12

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Enhanced f-string Debugging**
Python 3.12 makes debugging easier with enhanced `f-strings`.

```python
x, y = 10, 20
print(f"{x + y = }")  # Output: x + y = 30
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **More Flexible Type Hints**
Type annotations have improved, making static typing more powerful.

```python
from typing import Self

class Example:
    def chain(self) -> Self:
        return self  # Uses Self instead of Example
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **New `except*` Syntax for Exception Groups**
Introduces structured error handling for handling multiple exceptions.

```python
try:
    raise ExceptionGroup("Errors", [ValueError("Invalid"), TypeError("Wrong Type")])
except* ValueError as e:
    print("Caught ValueError:", e)
except* TypeError as e:
    print("Caught TypeError:", e)
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deprecated Features and Changes

- **Python 3.12 removes legacy Unicode C APIs** for better Unicode handling.
- `distutils` module is **fully removed**; use `setuptools` instead.
- Some older syntax patterns now raise **SyntaxWarnings**.

---

## üìå Conclusion

Python 3.12 is a **faster, more efficient, and more developer-friendly** update with notable syntax improvements and performance gains. Upgrade today and take advantage of these **powerful new features**!
